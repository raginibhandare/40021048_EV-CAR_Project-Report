## Introduction
An electric car is a one powered by an electric motor rather than a traditional petrol/diesel engine. This electric motor is powered by rechargeable batteries that can be charged by common household electricity. There are two types of EV technology: hybrid and pure electric.
### FULLY ELECTRIC CAR
The main parts in an electric car are a rechargeable battery, controller and electric motor. First, the battery is powered. Then the controller converts the current from DC-AC so that it can be used by the motor. The motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy.
### HYBRID CAR
The same technology exists in hybrid cars, alongside a small gasoline engine running a generator. This powers the car at cruising speed, and batteries provide extra power when accelerating. Batteries can recharge themselves when the car is decelerating or standing still. Hybrid technology means that your petrol goes much further, saving you money and reducing environmental impacts.

# Requirements

## 1.Battery :
1.Battery type used in this EV is Lithium-ion Polymer. 

2.Lithium is also the lightest of all metals. However, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries contain no lithium metal, they contain ions. For those wondering what an ion is, an ion is a an atom or molecule with an electric charge caused by the loss or gain of one or more electrons.

### Battery Features:

3.Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most popular forms of energy storage in the world, accounting for 85.6% of deployed energy storage systems.
## 2.Motor:

1.BLDC motors are used, which have traction characteristics like high starting torque, high efficiency around 95 98%,etc.

2.BLDC motors are suitable for high power density design approach. The BLDC motors are the most preferred motors for the electric vehicle application due to its traction characteristics.

### Motor Features:
3.Electronically commutated

4.High energy, rare earth magnets used for rotor field

5.Requires speed control with 6-lead connection (3 power,2 Hall Effects, 1 drain)

6.Rated speed 2500 RPM; minimum 150-200 RPM

7.Linear speed torque curves

8.Built-in tach pulse for economical speed readout

9.Encoder options for servo performance.

## 3.Controller:
1.Programmable BLDC motor controller provides efficient smooth and quite control for electric vehicles which operate 36V/48V battery system.

### controller Features:
1.E- Braking will release the motor from the controller as long as brake is applied.

2.Over current protection to protect controller during faulty conditions or short circuit.

3.Low voltage detection ensures Battery life.

4.Pedal assist mode controls the motor speed based on the speed of peddling.

5.Accelerator fault protection to prevent runway.

6.Provision for 120°/ 60° Selection.

7.Speedometer output.

8.Brake inputs with high active and low active provision.

9.Speed limit control provision.
## 4.Inverter :
1.The traction inverter converts energy from the vehicle's battery in order to drive the motors in the drivetrain. This key component has a direct impact on road performance, driving range and reliability of the vehicle also as a consequence of their weight and size.

2.Subject to all the possible stress found in a road vehicle from heat and vibrations, these converters must be able to handle high power and currents along with the associated Electro Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) challenges as well as provide fail-safe operation to ensure dependability and safety for the driver and passengers. 



3.To help developers increase the automotive inverter's power efficiency and reduce size and weight, ST has a wide offer of discrete semiconductors including AEC-Q101 qualified IGBTs and both silicon and silicon-carbide (SiC) MOSFETs and diodes, AEC-Q100 qualified galvanically isolated IGBT and MOSFET gate drivers and SPC5 32-bit automotive microcontrollers for designing scalable, cost-effective and energy-efficient EV traction inverter solutions.

### Inverter features :
4.Traction inverters are typically capable of transferring power in the 20 to 100 kW range, with switching voltages in the 200 V to 800 V range and currents in the hundreds of amperes.

## Electric vehicles now include cars, transit buses, trucks of all sizes, and even big-rig tractor trailers that are at least partially powered by electricity. ##
* Electric vehicles fall into three main categories:

* Battery electric vehicles are powered by electricity stored in a battery pack.
* Plug-in hybrids combine a gasoline or diesel engine with an electric motor and large rechargeable battery.
* Fuel cell vehicles split electrons from hydrogen molecules to produce electricity to run the motor.
